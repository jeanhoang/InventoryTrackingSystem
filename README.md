# Inventory Tracking System

This project creates a simple inventory tracking web app with basic CRUD functionality using Spring boot. 


For the simplicity of the project, all CRUD functions are displayed within the index/main page.
H2, JDBC and JPA are used for the database for this project, the edit and delete functions are executed by retrieving IDs for the chosen items.

Possible future improvements should include:
+ Add more parameters into the Item class since an inventory system includes other things such as price, description, category, etc.
+ Navigation to different pages for each functions
+ Security 
+ Filter option for different types of item
+ Add UI
